# EncodingMode

`Phuture\Coherence\Enum\EncodingMode`

```php
enum EncodingMode
```

Enumeration for HTML entity encoding strategies.

This enum defines how HTML encoding and decoding operations handle characters.
Each case represents a different level of encoding strictness. Use this enum
with \Phuture\Coherence\Html::entityEncode() and \Phuture\Coherence\Html::entityDecode()
to control which characters are converted to or from HTML entities.

## Cases

### `All`

```php
case All
```

Encodes or decodes all characters that have HTML entity equivalents.

When encoding, every character that can be represented as an HTML entity
(such as accented letters, currency symbols, etc.) is converted to its
entity form. When decoding, all HTML entities are converted back to their
original characters.

### `SpecialChars`

```php
case SpecialChars
```

Encodes or decodes only the characters that have special meaning in HTML.

When encoding, only the five characters with special meaning in HTML
(`&`, `"`, `'`, `<`, `>`) are converted to their entity forms.
When decoding, only these special character entities are restored.
All other characters (like accented letters) remain unchanged.
