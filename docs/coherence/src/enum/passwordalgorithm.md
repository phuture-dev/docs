# PasswordAlgorithm

`Phuture\Coherence\Enum\PasswordAlgorithm`

```php
enum PasswordAlgorithm
```

Enumeration for password hashing algorithm selection.

This enum defines the password hashing algorithms available when hashing or
rehashing passwords. Use it with \Phuture\Coherence\Hash::password() and
\Phuture\Coherence\Hash::passwordNeedsRehash() to select which algorithm to apply.

## Cases

### `Argon2i`

```php
case Argon2i
```

Use the Argon2I algorithm.

Argon2I is a memory-hard algorithm optimized to resist side-channel attacks.
It is the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition. Use this when
side-channel resistance is the primary concern. Requires PHP compiled with
libargon2 support.

### `Argon2id`

```php
case Argon2id
```

Use the Argon2ID algorithm.

Argon2ID is a memory-hard algorithm that provides resistance against GPU-based
brute-force attacks and side-channel attacks. It is the recommended choice for
new applications when available. Requires PHP compiled with libargon2 support.

### `Bcrypt`

```php
case Bcrypt
```

Use the BCrypt algorithm.

BCrypt is a well-established password hashing algorithm that is widely supported
and produces a 60-character hash. It is a safe choice when Argon2ID is not available.

### `Default`

```php
case Default
```

Use PHP's current recommended default algorithm.

Delegates the algorithm choice to PHP itself, which always points to the most
secure algorithm available in the current PHP version. This is the safest long-term
choice as it automatically upgrades when PHP changes its recommended default.
